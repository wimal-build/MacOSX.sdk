/**
 Create an enumerator for an item.

 When the user opens the browse tab of the UIDocumentsBrowserViewController and
 selects a file provider, this is called with
 NSFileProviderRootContainerItemIdentifier, and -[NSFileProviderEnumerator
 enumerateItemsForObserver:startingAtPage:] is immediately called to list the
 first items available under at the root level of the file provider.

 As the user navigates down into directories, new enumerators are created with
 this method, passing in the itemIdentifier of those directories.  Past
 enumerators are then invalidated.

 This method is also called with
 NSFileProviderWorkingSetContainerItemIdentifier, which is enumerated with
 -[NSFileProviderEnumerator enumerateChangesForObserver:fromSyncAnchor:].  That
 enumeration is special in that it isn't driven by the
 UIDocumentsBrowserViewController.  It happens in the background to sync the
 working set down to the device.

 This is also used to subscribe to live updates for a single document.  In that
 case, -[NSFileProviderEnumerator enumerateChangesToObserver:fromSyncAnchor:]
 will be called and the enumeration results shouldn't include items other than
 the very item that the enumeration was started on.

 If returning nil, you must set the error out parameter.

 Error cases:
 ------------
 If containerItemIdentifier is NSFileProviderTrashContainerItemIdentifier and
 the extension does not support trashing items, then it should fail the call
 with the NSFeatureUnsupportedError error code from the NSCocoaErrorDomain
 domain.

 If the item requested containerItemIdentifier does not exist in the provider,
 the extension should fail with NSFileProviderErrorNoSuchItem. In that case,
 the system will consider the item has been deleted and attempt to delete the
 item from disk.

 The extension can also report the NSFileProviderErrorNotAuthenticated,
 NSFileProviderErrorServerUnreachable in case the item cannot be fetched
 because of the current state of the system / domain. In that case, the
 system will present an appropriate error message and back off until the
 next time it is signalled.

 Any other error will be considered to be transient and will cause the
 enumeration to be retried.

/**
 Create a new item.

 The itemTemplate object describes the expected state of the newly created item,
 including its location provided by parentItemIdentifier and filename. The list
 of fields to conside in that object is defined by the fields parameter. Fields
 not listed should be considered as not being defined.

 If the item is a document, the contents should be fetched from the provided
 URL. Otherwise url will be nil. If the item is a symbolic link, the target
 path is provided by the symlinkTargetPath of the itemTemplate.

 The system is setting the itemIdentifier of the itemTemplate to a unique value that
 is guaranteed to stay the same for a given item in case the creation is replayed
 after a crash. That itemIdentifier is not intended to be the identifier assigned
 to the item by the provider.

 In the completion block, the createdItem is expected to reflect the properties of the
 newly created item, which usually means matching the properties passed in by the
 template. An exception is the itemIdentifier which should be the identifier assigned
 to that item by the provider rather than the identifier passed in through the template.
 If the provider reuses an existing identifier, the item that used that identifier will
 be removed from disk, replaced by the createdItem. If the item is a directory, the two
 directories will be merged and the items from the existing one will be modified with
 the NSFileProviderModifyItemMayAlreadyExist option set.

 If the provider is not able to apply all the fields at once, it should return a
 set of stillPendingFields in its completion handler. In that case, the system will
 attempt to modify the item later by calling modifyItem with those fields.

 If a field in the returned createdItem does not match the itemTemplate, and is
 not in the list of stillPendingFields, the value from the createdItem will be
 propagated to the disk. If the content of the item as described by createdItem
 does not match the content from url, the provider should set shouldFetchContent
 in the completion handler. The content from the provider will then be fetched
 and propagated to disk.

 In case the NSFileProviderCreateItemMayAlreadyExist option
 is passed, the content may be nil if the item is found by the system without any
 associated content. In that case, you should return a nil item if you are not
 able to match the created item with an existing item from the provider.

 In case of path collision with an already existing item, the provider
 can either fail using -[NSError (NSFileProviderError) fileProviderErrorForCollisionWithItem:]
 or resolve the collision by itself (e.g. by returning an item with a different name).
 If the error is returned, the system will try to resolve the collision by itself by bouncing
 away one of the items (renaming the item).

 If the imported item is refused by the extension, it should return nil for the
 createdItem without any error. In that case, the source item will be deleted
 from disk. If the extension does not wish to synchronise the item, while still
 keeping it on disk, it should still import it locally, but not sync it to its
 server, and return a valid createItem object. The non-imported item should be
 marked as being excluded from sync and should not declare the evictable capability.

 The progress returned by createItemBasedOnTemplate is expected to include the
 upload progress of the item and will be presented in the user interface until
 the completion handler is called.

 Creation is gated by the NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsAddingSubItems
 capability on the parent folder on a UI level, but direct file system changes
 (e.g. from Terminal) can still result in changes that must be handled.

 Error cases:
 ------------
 If the creation fails because the target directory does not exist, the extension
 must fail the creation using the NSFileProviderErrorNoSuchItem error code. In
 that case, the system will attempt the re-create the parent directory.

 In case the location of the new item is already in use by another item, the extension
 can chose to either resolve the collision by moving one of the items
 away, or reject the creation with the NSFileProviderErrorFilenameCollision
 error code. In that error case, the system will be responsible for resolving the
 collision, by renaming one of the colliding items. When the collision is resolved,
 the system will call createItemBasedOnTemplate again.

 The extension can also report the NSFileProviderErrorNotAuthenticated,
 NSFileProviderErrorServerUnreachable or NSFileProviderErrorInsufficientQuota
 in case the modification cannot be applied because of the current state of the
 system / domain. In that case, the system will present an appropriate error
 message and back off until the next time it is signalled.
 The provider can signal the error resolution by calling signalErrorResolved:completionHandler:.

 Any other error will be considered to be transient and will cause the
 creation to be retried.

/**
 Informs the provider that an item or its metadata have changed. More than one
 property may have changed, e.g.  an item may have been renamed, moved and also
 changed contents, in which case changedFields might contain [.contents,
 .filename, .parentItemIdentifier, .contentModificationDate].

 If the provider is not able to apply all the fields at once, it should return a
 set of stillPendingFields in its completion handler. In that case, the system will
 attempt to modify the item later by calling modifyItem with those fields.

 If a field in the returned item does not match the itemTemplate, and is
 not in the list of stillPendingFields, the value from the item will be
 propagated to the disk. In case there is a content change and the content of
 the returned item as described by item does not match the content from url,
 the provider should set shouldFetchContent in the completion handler. The
 content from the provider will then be fetched and propagated to disk.

 If the item modification results from the parent directory being merged into another
 directory, the NSFileProviderModifyItemMayAlreadyExist flag will be passed
 to the call.

 The provider can chose to merge two existing items when receiving modifyItem. In that
 case, the item returned should carry the itemIdentifier of the item with which the
 item will be merged and well as the resulting state of that item. The system will then
 keep one of the items (the one whose itemIdentifier was returned) and remove
 the other one from disk. In case of directories, the content of the two directories
 is merged and sub-items will be modified with the
 NSFileProviderModifyItemMayAlreadyExist flag set.

 The progress returned by modifyItem is expected to include the upload progress if any,
 even if the provider chose to call the completion handler before the upload finishes.
 For example, the provider might decide to call the completion handler as soon as the
 metadata have been stored in a local database.

 Modifications are gated by the corresponding capabilities of the item on a UI level,
 but direct file system changes (e.g. from Terminal) can still result in changes that
 must be handled.

 Cycle handling:
 ---------------
 The system guarantees that modifyItem called after local changes from the user will
 never create a cycle: that is all items will always be a descendent of either the
 root item or the trash item.

 However, cycles that are caused by concurrent local changes by the user and changes
 on the remote server can also create cycles. This is handled by the system as a
 conflict. This means the provider must validate that the call of modifyItem is not
 creating a cycle with a change it observed from the server. If such a cycle is
 detected, the provider must fix the conflict by breaking the cycle, and return the
 state of the item after resolving that conflict. If the resolution affects other
 items as well, updates for those other items must be published on the working set.

 Error cases:
 ------------
 The extension may fail the modification if the modified item does not exist
 anymore. In that case, the extension should fail the call the
 NSFileProviderErrorNoSuchItem error code. The system will attempt to delete
 the item on disk. If the item on disk actually has changes since this call
 to modifyItem, then it will be re-created by a call to createItemBasedOnTemplate.
 Likewise, if the item is reparented to a parent that no longer exists, the extension
 may return a NSFileProviderErrorNoSuchItem error with the parent item.

 In case the modification updates the location of the item and another item is
 already known at this location, the extension can chose to either resolve the
 collision by moving one of the items away, or reject the modification with
 the NSFileProviderErrorFilenameCollision error code. In that error case,
 the system will be responsible for resolving the collision, by renaming one of
 the colliding items. When the collision is resolved, the system will call
 modifyItem again.

 The extension can also report the NSFileProviderErrorNotAuthenticated,
 NSFileProviderErrorServerUnreachable or NSFileProviderErrorInsufficientQuota
 in case the modification cannot be applied because of the current state of the
 system / domain. In that case, the system will present an appropriate error
 message and back off until the next time it is signalled.
 The provider can signal the error resolution by calling signalErrorResolved:completionHandler:.

 Any other error will be considered to be transient and will cause the
 modification to be retried.

 the item should no longer appear there after this call.  This call should

 This call receives an optional baseVersion which represent the version of the
 item we are trying to delete.

 Unless the NSFileProviderDeleteItemRecursive options is passed, the
 deletion of a directory should be non-recursive. If the deletion is recursive
 the provider should take care of reporting the deletion of all the deleted
 items through the working set.

 Delete is gated by the capabilities of the removed item with
 NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsDeleting.

 Modifications are gated by NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsDeleting
 of the item on a UI level, but direct file system changes (e.g. from Terminal)
 can still result in changes that must be handled.

 Error cases:
 ------------
 The extension may fail the deletion in different scenarios, for instance because
 the baseVersion is out of date or because the user does not have permissions to
 delete the item. In that case the extension should fail the call with the
 NSFileProviderErrorDeletionRejected error code which will cause the system to
 re-create the deleted item on disk based on the latest metadata available from
 the extension.

 If the options don't include NSFileProviderDeleteItemRecursive and the
 deletion targets a non-empty directory, the extension must reject the deletion
 with the NSFileProviderErrorDirectoryNotEmpty error code. This error can also
 be reported in case some children of the directory cannot be deleted when
 receiving the NSFileProviderDeleteItemRecursive option. In both cases,
 the system will re-create the deleted item on disk based on the latest metadata
 available from the extension.

 If the deletion targets an item that is unknown from the extension because
 that item may have already been deleted remotely, then the extension should
 report a success.

 The extension can also report the NSFileProviderErrorNotAuthenticated and
 NSFileProviderErrorServerUnreachable in case the deletion cannot be applied
 because of the current state of the system / domain. In that case, the system
 will present an appropriate error message and back off until the next time it
 is signalled.

/**
 Called by the system if the set of materialized items changes.

 Materialized items are items that have synced to disk and are not
 dataless.  They may contain a mix of dataless and materialized files and
 directories, but in any case, all their children are represented on disk.
 Traversals of dataless directories by applications trigger an enumeration
 against the file provider extension; traversals of materialized directories
 do not.  It is the responsability of the file provider extension to notify
 the system on remote changes of these files: there is no alternative cache
 invalidation mechanism.

 If the extension doesn't keep track of the materialized set, it will have to
 notify the system of all remote changes.  In that case the working set is the
 entire dataset.  The system may drop items whose parent isn't materialized, to
 avoid unnecessary disk usage.  This saves some I/O, but isn't optimal.  The
 filtering by parentItemIdentifier is better done in the extension;  ideally,
 it would even be done server-side.  A hybrid model is possible, where some
 filtering is done server-side, and some finer filtering is done client-side.

 The file provider extension should therefore keep a list of the identifiers of
 the materialized directories.  This method is called when a new directory is
 materialized or when a materialized directory is rendered dataless.

 To enumerate the set of materialized containers,
 - Call -enumeratorForMaterializedItems on the instance of
   NSFileProviderManager corresponding to your domain;
 - Implement the NSFileProviderEnumerationObserver and
   NSFileProviderChangeObserver on an object;
 - Pass that object to the enumerator;
 - Use the identifiers of items or changes you receive to note the
   materialization status in your database.

 When an item is created, modified or deleted remotely, the file provider
 extension should check whether its parentItemIdentifier is in the materialized
 set.  If it is, the extension needs to inform the system so the system may
 create, modify or delete the file or directory (initially dataless) on disk.
 In the case when an item is reparented, the test should be that either the new
 or the old parentItemIdentifier is in the materialized set.  No need to pretend
 that the iten was deleted if the new parentItemIdentifier is no longer in the
 materialized set: the system will know what to do with an unknown parent
 identifier.

 To notify the system of this created, modified or deleted item,
 - Call -signalEnumeratorForContainerItemIdentifier: on the working set, i.e the
   container identified by NSFileProviderWorkingSetContainerItemIdentifier;
 - Include this item in the next enumeration of the working set.

 Since this method is called on every change of the set of materialized items,
 it is advisable to use it to set a flag and perform any resulting work as a
 timed task rather than performing any work directly.

/**
 The system calls this method to fetch thumbnails.

 The @p perThumbnailCompletionHandler should be called for each thumbnail, and
 @p completionHandler only after all the per thumbnail completion blocks.

 In the event of a global error, the implementation is allowed to skip calling
 the @p perThumbnailCompletionHandler for individual thumbnails. In that case,
 the @p completionHandler's error parameter would apply to all item identifiers
 for which @p perThumbnailCompletionHandler had not been called.

 If there is no thumbnail for a given item, the @p perThumbnailCompletionHandler
 should be called with its @p imageData and @p error parameters both
 set to nil.

 If the system decides that an in-flight thumbnail request is not needed anymore,
 it will call the returned @p NSProgress object's @p -cancel method,
 at which time the implementation should clean up any held resources.

 The system will cache the thumbnail for the item, and the cache will be
 invalidated when itemVersion.contentVersion changes.
